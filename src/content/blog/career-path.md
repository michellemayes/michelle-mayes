Music --> Public Policy --> Tech

That's the path I took to get into Data Science. It's not the most direct, but I wouldn't change it!

My experience in each industry taught me skills I use everyday as a professional in Data Science: 

✔️ Practice makes progress (Music) --> Coding is a skill that needs to be practiced everyday!

🗣 Communication skills (Public Policy) --> Knowing how to present and report your findings is essential.

📈 Data analytics & machine learning (Public Policy) --> Learning social science statistics and econometrics is a game changer.

💡 Work smarter (Tech) --> Embrace tight deadlines and improve your processes to become more efficient!
