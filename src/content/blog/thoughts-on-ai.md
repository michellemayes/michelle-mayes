Speed of development and solving problems is getting so fast with AI. 

Here's what I built (or helped build) this week, the tools I used, and how much time it saved: 

1. Custom Amazon Web Services (AWS) Lambda Layer using OpenAI Codex CLI (saved 4+ hours of work).
2. Looker LookML debugging query suite with Cursor Pro (saved 2+ days of work).
3. Voice to text AI enhancement workflow with Voice Ink and Groq (saved at least 30 minutes of typing so far per day).
4. Helped 2 coworkers ship multiple GSheets automations using Google Apps Script written by ChatGPT (saving them multiple hours a month, at least). Neither are coders!
5. Taught my husband how to prompt ChatGPT to build a custom Tampermonkey script for Google Chrome key stroke automation (this saves him an hour of time per day, at least). Also not a coder!

Moral of the story here is if you're not looking for ways to improve your workflow with AI daily you are in all likelihood falling behind.
